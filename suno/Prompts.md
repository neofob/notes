### Give It Up
```
The track opens with a gritty slide guitar bending a plaintive note, met by
the low drone of tanpura and a shuffling frame drum, Ancient atmospheres
form as the slide guitar wails with raw emotion, exchanging lines with an
Oud’s twisting melody, The frame drum intensifies, heartbeat-quick, before
receding to its dusty shuffle, Music dissolves to the tanpura’s deep drone,
ending abruptly in silence, Mississippi Delta Blues/World fusion

### That's Too Bad
```
Pop, a stripped-back and vulnerable track with female vocals, carried by soft
piano and subtle acoustic textures that create an intimate, confessional tone,
The verses are quiet and raw, building gently with delicate percussion before
opening into an emotionally honest chorus, The production is warm and organic,
focusing entirely on the vocal delivery, with tender harmonies and poignant
pauses that let the lyrics breathe, It’s simple, heartfelt, and quietly
cinematic, evoking a sense of longing and quiet resolve, upbeat, piano
