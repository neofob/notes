# Debugging Dreams
### Lyric
```
[Verse 1]
Caffeine whispers, midnight’s muse,
Broken loops I can't refuse.
Echoes in the debugger's glow,
Stack traces where my dreams won’t go.

[Prechorus]
Wheels spinning, riding small-town streets,
Chasing hope that never meets.

[Chorus]
I was building fault-tolerant dreams,
Now I'm scraping metrics, hollow schemes.
Deployed in clouds, lost in queues,
Not the code I’d choose, not the life I’d use.

[solo harmonica]

[Verse 2]
Foosball clatter, teammates cheer,
Startup days I held so near.
Burned out nights, crushed like glass,
Ambitions crumble, they don’t last.

[Prechorus]
The cycle turns, deploy, repeat,
Life reduced to YAML sheets.

[Chorus]
I was building fault-tolerant dreams,
Now I'm scraping metrics, hollow schemes.
Deployed in clouds, lost in queues,
Not the code I’d choose, not the life I’d use.

[solo guitar]
