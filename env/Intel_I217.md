### Intel I217 GigE chip

This Intel GigE chipset is used by many 1150 mother broads
(Asus, Gigabyte, ASRock..etc.).  The default kernel 3.2 or
3.5 coming with Debian Wheezy or Ubuntu 12.04.2 doesn't
support it.

Roll your own kernel 3.9 or later to get support for it.

You can also download the driver from [Intel Download][0]
